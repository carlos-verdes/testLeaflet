# mock origin destination map

This project was generated with the [Angular Full-Stack Generator](https://github.com/DaftMonk/generator-angular-fullstack) version 4.1.0.

This is a mock so the dependency with Mongo has been removed, only local files are read.
To change the data/behaviour it's necessary to edit main.component.js
